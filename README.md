### What is the hackathon?
There are two types of hackathon format you need to clarify before joining:
- **Ideathon**: Hacking is creative problem solving. (It does not have to involve technology.)
- **Project-based Hackathon**: A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems. Most hackathons Iâ€™ve run also have a parallel track for workshops.

Participants typically form groups of about 2-5 individuals, take out their laptops (if the event is technology themed), and dive into problems. Training workshops are a great parallel track especially for newcomers but also for all participants.
